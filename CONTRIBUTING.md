============

## Pull Request

We always welcome pull requests. Here's some general requirement for
pull requests be accepted:

1. [PEP8](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) is our coding style
   guide. For code be accepted, please make sure your code is PEP8
   ready. You can check your code using `pep8` command (`pep install
   pep8`)
2. Please create a branch before sending pull requests. We do not accept
   pull request from remote `master` branch.
3. Please send pull request to `dev` branch. We do not accept pull
   request to `master` branch.
4. Your commit should be atomic. That is, fix a bug or implementing a
   feature in one commit instead of multiple commit. This is a
   recommendation, not a requirement.
5. Your commit message should be meaningful. First line should be lesser
   or equal to equal to 72 characters, containing a brief information
   about the commmit. The first line should start with one of `Add:` for
   add, `Mod:` for modification, `Ref:` for refactoring, `Rea:` for
   readability improvement, `Rem:` for removing file or feature. This is
   a recommendation, not a requirement.
